# Asymmetric Moonphase — Design Notes

Asymmetric Moonphase is the project's homage of the A. Lange & Söhne Lange 1
Moonphase. Story 1.6 ships it. Architecturally: this dial is the **second
falsification test** for the `DialRenderer` protocol — the non-concentric
layout stress test. (Royale was the digital-paradigm stress test in Story 1.5.)

Inspired by the A. Lange & Söhne Lange 1 Moonphase.

## Visibility

`.default` — Asymmetric is one of the project's main user-facing dials and
appears in the prefs picker normally. Unlike Royale (`.hidden` easter egg),
this dial is the first thing a new user sees if they activate the screensaver.

## Design decisions

### D1: Round case + gold bezel + silver dial

**Decision.** Round watch case with a warm-gold bezel (vertical-tilt gradient
from highlight at upper-left → shadow at lower-right, matching Royale's
single-light-source convention), silver-champagne dial face, gold hands.

**Why.** Matches the reference photo's gold-case Lange 1 Moonphase variant.
Warm/luxurious feel. Distinct from Royale's silver chamfered-rectangle case.

**Rejected alternatives.** Platinum case + heat-blued hands (the platinum
Lange 1 variant exists), white-gold + dark dial. Caleb chose gold per
AskUserQuestion answer 2026-05-13.

### D2: Continuous angular moonphase

**Decision.** Moon disc translates laterally across the navy aperture based
on a continuous lunar phase fraction `[0, 1)`. Math anchored to a documented
new moon at 2000-01-06 18:14:00 UTC; synodic month = 29.530588868 days.

**Why.** Real watches show smooth phase transitions; a 28-frame discrete
sequence would visibly step once per day. Continuous math is also more
compact (no per-frame asset bundling).

**Rejected alternative.** 28-frame discrete sequence with pre-rendered moon
shapes. Simpler math but visibly stepped. Caleb chose continuous per
AskUserQuestion answer 2026-05-13.

### D3: Trademark surface — omit entirely

**Decision.** No `A. Lange & Söhne`, no `Glashütte I/SA`, no `Made in
Germany`, no `Gangreserve 72 Stunden` on the rendered dial. Brand credit
appears only in `credit.txt` and `DialIdentity.homageCredit`.

**Why.** Matches the legal posture established for Royale (Story 1.5 AC2).
Brand name appears in credits, never on the dial.

**Rejected alternative.** Include the German functional label
"GANGRESERVE 72 STUNDEN" as decorative text. Borderline — it's product-
feature text, not strictly brand, but reads as brand-adjacent. Caleb chose
the strict omit per AskUserQuestion answer 2026-05-13.

### D4: Power reserve tied to laptop battery

**Decision.** The power reserve indicator (`AUF` at upper-right, `AB` at
lower-right) reflects the laptop's current battery percentage. On desktop
Macs (no battery in the IOKit power-sources array), the indicator points
at `AUF` (full power). On any IOKit error, the indicator defaults to full.

**Why.** Per Caleb's "Other" answer to AskUserQuestion 2026-05-13. Maps
the watch's mechanical power-reserve indicator to a real-world Mac metric.
Practical and a small delight.

**Rejected alternatives.**
- Static always-full (simplest, but loses the "watch-keeps-track-of-power"
  storytelling).
- Decay simulation over 72 hours of screensaver runtime (complex; doesn't
  reset across `.saver` activations; meaningless on desktops).
- Tied to system uptime (quirky; would always point to AUF on freshly-booted
  Macs, AB after weeks of uptime — doesn't quite map to the watch metaphor).

### D5: Non-concentric anchor strategy

**Decision.** All five readouts (main time + moonphase + big date +
sub-seconds + power reserve) are placed at fixed canvas-relative anchors
expressed as fractions of the dial radius:

- Main time sub-dial center: `(caseCenter.x - 0.20·dialRadius, caseCenter.y)`
- Moonphase aperture: inside main time, `+0.40·mainTimeRadius` above its center
- Big date: `(+0.30·dialRadius, +0.42·dialRadius)` from case center
- Sub-seconds: `(+0.30·dialRadius, -0.40·dialRadius)` from case center
- Power reserve: `(+0.68·dialRadius, 0)` from case center

The anchors live in a `LayoutAnchors` struct that's recomputed on each
`canvasDidChange`. No reliance on the case center for sub-readout positioning.

**Why.** Lange 1's defining visual is asymmetry. Every readout occupies a
distinct region of the dial; nothing is concentric with the case. The
`DialRenderer` protocol's `canvas: CGSize` parameter is enough — sub-dials
position themselves relative to whatever fractional offsets the dial author
picks.

### D6: Roman numerals + Arabic sub-seconds

**Decision.** Main time sub-dial uses Roman numerals at 12/3/6/9 (XII, III,
VI, IX), with simple tick marks at the other 8 hour positions and 60 small
ticks for minutes. Sub-seconds dial uses Arabic numerals at 10/20/30/40/50/60
positions.

**Why.** Matches the reference photo. Roman numerals are part of the Lange 1
aesthetic. Arabic on the sub-seconds preserves at-a-glance readability for
the smaller dial where Roman would be hard to read.

**Rejected alternative.** Arabic numerals everywhere (more readable but
loses the formal aesthetic).

### D7: Reduce-motion contract

- Integer-second dedup: `tick(reduceMotion: true)` returns early when the
  integer second hasn't advanced.
- Hour + minute hands tick to position (no animation between minute boundaries;
  `CATransaction.setDisableActions(true)` is wrapped around all transform
  writes).
- Sub-seconds hand: FREEZES in reduce-motion (same pattern as Royale's
  outer-ring seconds tick).
- Moonphase: freezes at whatever lunar phase was current when reduce-motion
  engaged.
- Power reserve indicator: continues to follow battery state regardless
  (battery changes are not "ambient animation" — they're real-world events
  the user might want to see).

### D8: Battery query as a non-P4 side channel

**Decision.** The renderer is allowed to call `IOPSCopyPowerSourcesInfo()`
(via `AsymmetricMoonphaseMath.powerReserveFraction()`) directly. This does
NOT violate P4 (TimeSource injection) because battery state is not "time" —
it's a separate side channel.

**Why.** P4 exists to make time-driven content testable via `FixedTimeSource`.
Battery state has no equivalent testability concern — it's a one-shot read
of system state, with defensive fallback to `1.0` on any error per P10. The
function lives in the math file (not the renderer) so the responsibility is
clear; the renderer just asks "what value to show", not "how to query IOKit".

## Protocol-amendment assessment (AC8)

**Outcome (a): protocol survived the non-concentric layout stress test.
No amendment needed.**

The `DialRenderer` contract held cleanly across paradigm-mixing-WITHIN-a-dial
(Story 1.5.2) AND non-concentric-layout-OF-multiple-readouts (Story 1.6).
Per-method:

- **`attach(rootLayer:canvas:timeSource:)`** — fit cleanly. The `canvas:
  CGSize` parameter is geometric; sub-readouts position themselves relative
  to fractional offsets within that canvas. No protocol-level knowledge of
  "where the dial center is" is required.
- **`tick(reduceMotion: Bool) -> [CGRect]`** — fit cleanly. All five readouts
  update from the same tick. The dirty-rect return value scales naturally:
  Asymmetric returns 7 rects (vs Royale's 5), no contract change needed.
- **`canvasDidChange(to:)`** — fit cleanly. `layoutLayers` recomputes the
  `LayoutAnchors` struct + repaints; same shape as Royale.
- **`detach()`** — fit cleanly. Removing `caseBackgroundLayer.removeFromSuperlayer()`
  cascades.

**This extends the AC8 finding from Story 1.5 + 1.5.2 to three confirmed
stress cases:** digital paradigm + paradigm-mixing-within-a-dial +
non-concentric-layout-across-readouts. Epic 2's remaining four dials
(Coke GMT, Octagon, Moonchrono, Diver) are execution rather than architecture.

## Polish pass (Story 1.6, post-first-pass — 2026-05-13)

Addressed Caleb's 7-point critique on the first-pass snapshot:

1. **Hands → elongated arrowhead / lance.** `goldHandPath(taper:)` reshaped
   with a wide rounded tail, slim shaft, spear-blade shoulder near the tip,
   sharp point — matches Lange 1 silhouette. Non-tapered variant kept as a
   slimmer leaf shape for the sub-seconds hand.
2. **Big date → gold frames + drop shadow.** `bigDateGoldFrame1/2` layers
   insert a gold rounded-rect behind each white box. Numerals get
   `CALayer.shadow*` with `shadowPath` updated each tick. Font switched to
   Didot-Bold (fallback chain: Bodoni 72 Bold → Times New Roman Bold).
3. **Aperture shape → semicircle top + two rolling-hill bites.**
   `buildAperturePath(in:)` constructs the silhouette: top semicircular arc +
   two quadratic Beziers as upward "hills" cutting into the baseline. Bezier
   gives independent control of hill width vs height (semicircles couldn't —
   they made the aperture read as "heart-shaped").
4. **Moonphase rendering → actual lunar phase via two-disc occulter.**
   `moonphaseOcculterLayer` (navy disc) translates over the stationary moon
   based on `AsymmetricMoonphaseMath.moonPhaseFraction(for:)`. Piecewise
   formula in `updateMoonphaseTransform`: waxing (`f ≤ 0.5`) shifts occulter
   left, waning (`f > 0.5`) shifts right. Result: waxing crescent shows
   bright on right, full at f≈0.5, waning crescent shows bright on left
   (northern-hemisphere convention).
5. **Power reserve → tick marks, no arc.** `powerReserveArcLayer.path` now
   contains 13 stroked lines along the arc radius (major ticks at AUF /
   midpoint / AB), drawn in `numeralBlack` with rounded caps.
6. **Sub-dial frames → recessed shadow rings.** `mainTimeOuterRing` and
   `subSecondsFaceLayer.strokeColor` no longer gold (was `handGold`, now
   `subDialShadow`). Added `mainTimeRecessShade` / `subSecondsRecessShade`
   `CAGradientLayer`s with vertical dark-top → light-bottom gradient masked
   to the face circle — sells the inset/recessed effect.
7. **Sizes + positions retuned.** Main time radius `0.42 → 0.48 · dialRadius`,
   center pulled slightly further left + down. Big date / sub-seconds slid
   right to clear the bigger main time. Power reserve radius `0.26 → 0.18`,
   center pulled inward. Aperture width `0.34 → 0.40 · mainTimeRadius`.

## Polish pass A (post-reference-comparison — 2026-05-13)

After Caleb compared the rendering to the Lange 1 reference photo, we
landed a second round of changes:

1. **Hands redesigned.** `goldHandPath(taper:withHole:)` now produces a true
   Lange lance: small lozenge tail behind the pivot (counterweight), slim
   shaft, lozenge blade near the tip, sharp point. Minute hand gets a circular
   hole near the pivot (CAShapeLayer `.evenOdd` fill rule). Layer bounds + 
   anchorPoint adjusted so the tail extends behind the pivot.
2. **Gold lozenge hour markers** at the 8 non-cardinal positions (1, 2, 4,
   5, 7, 8, 10, 11) — sculptural diamond shapes pointing radially outward,
   filled `handGold` with a thin `caseGoldShadow` stroke for edge definition.
   The hour tick lines at non-cardinals are removed (markers replace them);
   the 60-tick minute track stays.
3. **Moonphase rebuilt around sliding the moon disc.** Per the reference
   photo, the aperture's bottom arches are decorative — they nibble the moon
   as it transits. We dropped the previous "navy occulter" technique and now:
   - Maintain a STATIONARY aperture-masked container (`moonphaseDiscContainer`)
   - Inside it, a MOVING sublayer (`moonphaseMovingLayer`) holds the gold
     moon disc + man-in-the-moon face
   - Phase fraction translates the moving layer laterally: `dx = (hw + R) ·
     (1 - 2·f)`. At f=0 (new moon) the moon is offscreen RIGHT, at f=0.5
     centered (full), at f=1 offscreen LEFT.
   - The mask is on the stationary container, so the moon slides past
     a fixed aperture — exactly the visual mechanism of the real watch.
   Hills are now SUBTLE (`hillHeight = hw * 0.06`) — they just nibble the
   moon's bottom edge during transit.
4. **Moonphase decorations.** 8 four-point gold stars in the peripheral
   navy regions; man-in-the-moon (two eye dots + curved smile) on the moon
   disc, parented to the moving layer so it slides with the moon.
5. **Big date frames** are thinner (`frameInset = h*0.025`), less rounded
   (`cornerR = h*0.04`), and the two white boxes butt closer (`gap = h*0.025`).
6. **Power reserve** pulled inward (center `0.62 → 0.55 · dialRadius`) so it
   sits clearly in the dial face rather than against the bezel. Tick count
   dropped 12 → 8 for a less-crowded reading; majors at AUF / midpoint / AB.

## Polish pass B — gloss / matte (2026-05-13)

Per Caleb: the Lange 1's sub-dials are GLOSSY (polished silver), while the
surrounding faceplate is MATTE.

Implementation: added `mainTimeGlossLayer` + `subSecondsGlossLayer` as
`CAGradientLayer`s with `.radial` type. Each is a radial highlight at the
upper-LEFT of the sub-dial face (startPoint 0.30, 0.78), fading outward to
transparent. Masked to the sub-dial's face circle and layered ABOVE the
recess shade (which was simultaneously reduced in intensity so the gloss
reads clearly without fighting the recess gradient).

The faceplate stays as a flat silver fill — by contrast it now reads as
matte. No additional faceplate texture needed.

## Polish pass C — composition mirror (2026-05-13)

After side-by-side measurement against the Lange 1 reference photo, retuned
positions, sizes, and the moonphase aperture shape to mirror the reference:

1. **Layout anchors** —
   - `mainTimeCenter` ( -0.22, +0.02 ) → ( -0.13, -0.05 )
   - `mainTimeRadius` 0.48 → 0.50
   - `bigDateCenter` ( +0.42, +0.45 ) → ( +0.22, +0.45 )
   - `bigDateHeight` 0.22 → 0.16
   - `subSecondsCenter` ( +0.38, -0.42 ) → ( +0.30, -0.45 )
   - `powerReserveCenter` ( +0.55, -0.02 ) → ( +0.55, -0.08 )
   - `powerReserveRadius` 0.20 → 0.30 (taller-vertical-feel arc)
2. **Romans + lozenge markers pushed to perimeter** —
   `romanRadius` 0.68·r → 0.82·r; `markerCenterR` 0.83·r → 0.92·r; minute
   ticks pulled outward to 0.95-0.99·r so they don't collide with markers.
3. **Moonphase aperture became a wide horizontal oval** — `buildAperturePath`
   now traces the top with two cubic Beziers (using the 4·(√2-1)/3 ≈ 0.5523
   ellipse-approximation constant) instead of `addArc`. New
   `moonphaseHalfHeight = moonphaseHalfWidth * 0.55` gives the Lange-1
   ~2:1 width-to-height ratio. Hill peak height scaled to the new
   aperture height. Moon disc + man-in-the-moon re-anchored for the
   shorter aperture; stars repositioned to left/right margins where the
   moon doesn't cover at full-moon position.
4. **Power reserve** — narrower angular span (`π/2 → π/2.2`, ~82°) gives
   a less-arc-like, more vertical-scale appearance.

Sub-seconds and big-date intentionally overlap the main time outer ring,
matching the reference photo where these elements visibly intrude on the
main sub-dial's perimeter.

## Polish pass D — raised hour markers + power reserve refinement (2026-05-13)

After Caleb added two Lange 1 detail close-up reference images, the dial-level
zoom revealed:
1. Hour markers read as RAISED 3D studs with shading, not flat lozenges.
2. The power reserve scale is much more subtle than my earlier rendering —
   AUF / AB labels dominate, ticks are barely visible.

Changes:
1. **`mainTimeHourMarkersLayer` gains a subtle CALayer drop shadow**
   (alpha 0.35, offset (0.5, -0.5), radius 0.8). `shadowPath` set to the
   markers path for performance. Sells the "applied gold stud" feel.
2. **Power reserve ticks softened** — strokeColor `numeralBlack` → 
   `subDialNumeral` (warmer/lighter), lineWidth `r·0.05 → r·0.030`.
   Minor ticks shortened (r·0.91 → r·0.93 inner) so majors dominate.

## Polish pass D' — corrections from user feedback

I initially misread polished-gold glint on the hands as a hollow-lozenge
"open blade" — added an inner lozenge subpath. Caleb corrected: the hands
are SOLID gold (Lange hands are solid; the glint is just reflection on the
polished surface). Reverted that change.

Also clarified that **Roman numerals are RAISED GOLD EMBOSSINGS**, not
painted black text. Changed `mainTimeNumeralsLayer.fillColor` from
`numeralBlack` → `handGold` and added the same drop-shadow technique as
the hour markers (alpha 0.40, offset (0.6, -0.6), radius 1.0) plus a
thin `caseGoldShadow` stroke. The Romans now read as applied-gold
elements matching the markers.

Hand-blade proportions also retuned: lozenge now occupies 40-90% of the
forward length (was 50-92%) with the peak at the symmetric midpoint of
the blade — larger, more prominent diamond near the tip.

## Polish pass E — design-spec implementation (2026-05-13)

Iterations weren't converging — I'd read images, get a detail wrong, fix it,
miss another. To break the loop, I had a designer-style agent do a deep
pass on all three reference photos in `faces/` and produce
`design-spec.md` — a comprehensive Swift implementation specification with
exact positions, sizes, colors, paths, lighting, z-order. Then I
implemented from that spec in one shot rather than iterating on details.

Key changes (full diff vs prior pass):

1. **Palette overhaul** — exact sRGB triples for every color per the spec,
   new entries: `caseGoldMid`, `caseInnerLip`, `dialFaceShadow`,
   `moonFaceBronze`, `dateBoxInnerShadow`. Removed unused `dateSeparator`.
2. **Slimmer bezel** — `dialRadius = caseRadius * 0.93` (was 0.88); 4-stop
   gold gradient; engraved inner-lip stroke with semi-transparent dark.
3. **Skeumorphic recess** — 4 layers per sub-dial: recess gradient
   (vertical) + radial gloss (upper-left) + upper-rim shadow stroke with
   downward CALayer shadow (simulates the lip blocking light) + lower-rim
   highlight stroke masked to the bottom 40%. Same recipe for both sub-dials.
4. **Hour markers** — slender vertical diamonds (long 0.085, wide 0.030,
   at r·0.86 instead of r·0.92). Drop shadow retained.
5. **Roman numerals** — Bodoni 72 Book (NOT bold) at radius 0.86 (was 0.82),
   size 0.13 (was 0.16). Sit on the same circle as the lozenge markers.
6. **Minute ticks** — thin hairlines (r·0.012), butt-capped, slightly
   translucent near-black.
7. **Hands** — shaft 18%, tail 55%, blade 42-92% of forward length with
   peak at 66% (symmetric). No pivot eye on either hand. Drop shadows +
   thin gold-shadow stroke for facet definition.
8. **Center hub** — smaller (0.040 vs 0.05) with drop shadow.
9. **Moonphase** — aperture height factor 0.58 (was 0.55); moon disc
   `hh·0.72`; moon-face uses new `moonFaceBronze` for contrast; stars
   repositioned per spec; aperture rim gains a drop shadow.
10. **Big date** — corner radius 0.06, frame inset 0.045, gap 0.04. Removed
    separator entirely. Inner-shadow stroke on white boxes. Frame drop shadow.
11. **Sub-seconds** — full main-time recipe (recess, gloss, rim shadow,
    lower-half highlight). Tick layers split into major + minor with
    different line widths. Numerals at r·0.68. Hand = slim needle.
12. **Power reserve** — span `π/2.4 ≈ 75°`, radius 0.32, major/minor split,
    smaller red triangles (0.085 vs 0.10), smaller labels, smaller hand.

The design spec at `design-spec.md` is the single source of truth going
forward — any future visual change should update it first.

## Open follow-ups

- Faceplate stippling overlay (~6% alpha noise) not yet implemented; the
  matte-with-no-specular treatment already reads as matte by contrast
  against the polished sub-dials, but a real stipple texture would push
  closer to photoreal.
- Man-in-the-moon detail still subtle at typical screensaver zoom.
